## Features
- Upload any CSV file
- Ask natural language questions about the data
- Accurate, code-verified answers
- Clear explanations generated by a local LLM
- No API keys or paid services

---

## Supported Question Types (Initial)
- Average of a column  
- Maximum value in a column  
- Minimum value in a column  

(Designed to be easily extended.)

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Ollama (Qwen model for local inference)

---

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates:
- Safe and reliable GenAI system design
- Proper separation of reasoning and computation
- Hallucination prevention strategies
- Real-world GenAI application architecture

These are **core skills required in production GenAI systems**.

---

## Limitations
- Only basic aggregation queries are supported initially
- Column names must be referenced clearly in the question
- Complex multi-step queries are out of scope for this version

---

## Future Enhancements
- Group-by and aggregation queries
- Chart generation
- Query validation and guardrails
- Support for larger datasets
- SQL-style querying

---

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I aim to:
- Design hallucination-resistant GenAI systems
- Integrate LLMs with structured data safely
- Build explainable AI workflows
- Apply GenAI to practical data analysis problems

---

## Status
🚧 **In development** — implementation planned next.
